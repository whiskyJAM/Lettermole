						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This privacy policy applies to the LETTERMOLE app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Joseph Macari (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

							<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
							<p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address).</li>
								<li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages.</li>
								<li>The time spent on the Application.</li>
								<li>The operating system you use on your mobile device.</li>

						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h3>Third Party Access</h3>
							<p>Only aggregated, anonymised data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. Please note that the Application utilises third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
